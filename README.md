# HOG
Pedestrian detection system using HOG

This work investigates the use of Hierarchical Oriented Gradients (HOG) to improve pedestrian identification in tough metropolitan situations. The demand for robust algorithms continues to grow as intelligent transportation systems become more prevalent. HOG, noted for its capacity to capture local object structures, is being tested for its potential to improve accuracy and reliability in pedestrian detection. The study compares HOG-based systems to existing techniques in detail, offering insight on their strengths and limitations. The findings provide vital insights into improving pedestrian recognition in real-world circumstances, which is critical for the continued advancement of intelligent transportation and surveillance systems.
